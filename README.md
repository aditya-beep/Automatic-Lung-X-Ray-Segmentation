# Automatic-Lung-X-Ray-Segmentation
Segmentation of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis of chest X-Ray (CXR) images. CXRs are one of the most commonly prescribed medical imaging procedures with the voluminous CXR scans placing significant load on radiologists and medical practitioners. Automated organ segmentation is a key step towards computer-aided detection and diagnosis of diseases from CXRs. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional network model trained in an end-to-end setting to facilitate fully automatic lung segmentation from anteroposterior (AP) or posteroanterior (PA) view chest X-Rays, which is based on the UNet++ model architecture, using Efficient Net B4 as the encoder and residual blocks from ResNet to create our decoder blocks. Our network learns to predict binary masks for a given CXR, by learning to discriminate regions of organ, in this case the lungs, from regions of no organ and achieves very realistic and accurate segmentation. In order to generalize our model to CXRs we also employ image pre-processing techniques like top-hat bottom-hat transform, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), in addition to a couple of randomized augmentation techniques. The datasets chosen 
by us are also critical components in various computer-aided diagnosis of CXR  algorithms.
