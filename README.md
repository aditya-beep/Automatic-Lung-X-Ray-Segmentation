# Automatic-Lung-X-Ray-Segmentation
In this project, we propose  a deep convolutional network model trained in an end-to-end setting to  facilitate fully automatic lung segmentation from anteroposterior (AP) or  posteroanterior (PA) view chest X-Rays, which is based on the UNet++  model architecture, using Efficient Net B4 as the encoder and residual blocks  from ResNet to create our decoder blocks. Our network learns to predict  binary masks for a given CXR, by learning to discriminate regions of organ,  in this case the lungs, from regions of no organ and achieves very realistic  and accurate segmentation.
